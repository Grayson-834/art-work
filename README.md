# art-work

My very first repository on Github

https://github.com/Grayson-834/art-work?tab=readme-ov-file

## Description
I've had no experience creating a project in Github, so this one might not be as good as the others. The programmer should be able to create a portrait of the Eiffel Tower and this is relevant to media and digit arts because they'll be using code for a recreation.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- The programmer will try to recreate the background.
- Feature 2
	- The programmer will try to recreate the tourists.
- Feature N 
	- The programmer will try to recreate the tower itself.

## Challenges
- They'll have to use an art program from the pip application feature to create the scenery.
- Try to add a mime to the scenery.
- Try to add tourists.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The programmer should have a full scene of Paris.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The programmer should at least have an Eiffel Tower visible

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Recreate the Eiffel Tower
  2. Add a mime

- Week 2
  1. Add tourists
  2. Add trees

- Week N (Final)
  1. Add bushes
